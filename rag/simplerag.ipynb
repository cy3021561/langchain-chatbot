Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\nFig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9. Comparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

Roman, Aiden Chang, Hyunkeun Park, Kevin Hopkins, Shrutika Shrutika, Tom Yang\\nViterbi School of Engineering, University of Southern California, California, USA\\nABSTRACT\\nDeepfake detection is the task of detecting videos that have\\nbeen generated or manipulated using deep learning. Detect-\\ning deepfakes is crucial to prevent the spread of misinfor-\\nmation in audio-visual media. Recent advancements in the\\nfield include joint learning of audio and visual information,\\nby training independent modules and making a decision be-\\ntween learned embeddings from both modalities. While pre-\\nvious methods are robust when mainly the video content has\\nbeen manipulated, they often face challenges when only the\\naudio is manipulated. Our model, dubbed 2D3MF, proposes\\na novel method that exploits the relationship between emo-\\ntions conveyed in audio and video for multi-modal deepfake\\ndetection. We benchmark our approach using RA VDESS,\\na popular emotion detection dataset, as well as three of the\\nmost commonly used deepfake datasets: DFDC, FaceForen-\\nsics++, and FakeA VCeleb. Experiments demonstrate that the\\nproposed framework using emotion embeddings followed by\\nmiddle fusion, yields state-of-the-art performance and robust\\ncross-dataset generalization on commonly used emotion and\\ndeepfake datasets.\\nOur code and models can be found at: https://\\ngithub.com/aiden200/2D3MF and our project website\\ncan be found at http://2d3mf.ahmen.io:20241/ .\\n1. INTRODUCTION\\nRecent progress in generative AI is steadily increasing the\\nversatility and realism of deepfake video technology. In the\\naudio domain, speech can be synthesized using text-to-speech\\n(TTS) [1] or manipulated using voice conversion (VC) meth-\\nods [2]. The video modality has also undergone advance-\\nments via generative algorithms such as Generative Adversar-\\nial Networks (GAN) [3], Difusion models [4], and Variational\\nAutoencoders (V AE) [5]. With such deeplearning techniques,\\nvideos of real subjects, can be easily manipulated. This raises\\nsome ethical and legal concerns as the proliferation of modi-\\nfied media may be misused used to spread misinformation on\\nthe internet.\\nVarious features have been proposed to perform deepfake\\ndetection [6, 7, 8]. Before the advent of advanced TTS or\\nVC methods, most deepfake detection techniques were uni-\\nmodal, focusing on identifying visual artifacts or traces from\\ndeepfake generation frameworks [9, 10]. However, these\\nFig. 1 . Architecture of the 2D3MF model.\\nmethods face challenges addressing modern manipulations\\nthat entail multiple modalities. Most recently, multimodal\\ndeepfake detection has particularly focused on detecting\\ndeepfakes in audio-visual data. Some methods target syn-\\nchronization anomalies between audio and video [11, 12],\\nflagging deepfakes when the two modalities are not time-\\naligned. Other methods extract embeddings from audio and\\nvideo pre-trained models and make decisions by learning the\\nrelationship between the embeddings from either modality\\n[7, 13]. Nevertheless, both approaches present shortcomings\\nwhen only one modality is modified with high quality or\\nwhen both modalities are corrupted.\\nWe hypothesize that by capturing emotional characteris-\\ntics, the embeddings will contain rich, high-level and cross-\\nmodality features, that are well-suited for deepfake detection.\\nWe observe that the lack of naturality in deepfakes often stems\\nfrom flaws in emotional expression, incongruous voice tones,\\nand unnatural facial movements. To address these issues, we\\nhave developed various Deepfake Video Detection (DVD) ar-\\nchitectures that integrate encoding models originally designed\\nfor tasks such as facial expression analysis, emotive analysis,', metadata={'source': '2D3MF.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

High-level overview of our 2D3MF with audio and video inputs fused using Self and Cross-Attention middle fusion via\\ntransformer attention.\\nand speaker identification. These networks extract useful fa-\\ncial and speech representations, proving essential for the ef-\\nfectiveness of DVD tasks.\\nIn this work, we study the utility of audio-visual emo-\\ntion speaker embeddings, representations extracted from pre-\\ntrained audio and video networks, as robust features for the\\nDVD task. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first\\nto leverage abstract representations of emotions in the audio-\\nvisual domain to highlight and detect inconsistencies in fake\\nvideos. We propose 2D3MF (Deepfake Detection with Multi\\nModal Middle Fusion), which is a novel middle fusion strat-\\negy where audio and visual data are synergistically analyzed\\nto capture discrepancies in emotional expressions, and vocal\\ntones. These features reveal the subtle yet critical flaws inher-\\nent in deepfake videos, enabling our model to discern authen-\\ntic content from manipulated media with precision.\\nIn the video modality, we explore networks originally\\nused as high level facial feature extractors. We use Ef-\\nficientFace [14], which has been shown to work well on\\nmulti-modal emotion detection tasks [15]. We also integrate\\nMARLIN [16], a video masked auto-encoder (MAE) that is\\ncapable of learning broad facial representations from videos.\\nIn the audio modality, we explore the use of features such as\\nmel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), xvectors [17],\\npre-trained ResNet18 embeddings, emotion2vec embeddings\\n[18], and audio masked autoencoder embeddings using EAT\\n[19]. In summary, our contributions are:\\n1. We demonstrate that our framework, 2D3MF, produces\\nembeddings that effectively capture emotional char-\\nacteristics with minimal additional training, achieving\\nstate-of-the-art performance in classifying 8 different\\nemotions.2. Using this framework, we present a complete set of ex-\\nperiments that demonstrate the feasibility of audio and\\nvideo emotion embeddings used for deepfake detec-\\ntion, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 3 dif-\\nferent major deepfake datasets.\\n3. Finally we release a public GitHub repository where all\\nthe experiments presented can be easily reproduced.\\n2. RELATED WORK\\n2.1. Video Representation Learning\\nMost existing literature on deepfake detection is conducted\\nin a supervised manner[16]. It has been shown that much\\nof the state-of-the-art success in deepfake detection stems\\nfrom accurately identifying high-level features[16]. How-\\never, achieving optimal results requires high-quality anno-\\ntations and a large quantity of them. To address this issue,\\nmany recent models have adopted the approach of training us-\\ning self-supervision, followed by fine-tuning in a supervised\\nmanner for domain specific downstream tasks. Among these\\nself-supervised methods, Masked Auto Encoders (MAE)\\nhave been a popular example. In this approach, models are\\ntrained to reconstruct masked regions of a video using Vision\\nTransformers [20]. Many of these works focus primarily\\non videos that feature human faces, learning to represent\\nhigh-level facial features effectively.\\n2.2. Audio Representation Learning\\nIn the audio domain, various methods of audio representa-\\ntion learning have been proposed. Two branches of represen-', metadata={'source': '2D3MF.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='tation learning can be identified: semi-supervised and self-\\nsupervised.\\nIn the semi-supervised realm, previous research has\\nshown that deep networks trained on large datasets learn\\nto extract robust features that are invariant to resolution,\\ndomain shifts, or media artifacts. These features, obtained\\nfrom intermediate outputs of deep networks are referred to\\nin the literature as ’embeddings’, and they are often used\\nin downstream tasks. In this study we leverage the work of\\nAldeneh et al. [21] that uses xvector embeddings extracted\\nfrom a speaker identification network. In their research,\\nxvectors were found to be robust at abstracting emotions fea-\\ntures, which we then show to be robust for the downstream\\ntask of deepfake detection. Following the utility of emo-\\ntion embeddings for deepfake detection tasks, we pre-train a\\nResNet18 network to perform 8 emotion classification using\\nthe RA VDESS dataset. We extract embeddings from this\\npre-trained network.\\nIn the self-supervised realm, recent work has introduced\\nmodels such as emotion2vec [18], which uniquely performs\\nuniversal speech emotion learning. Similar to the video do-\\nmain, audio Masked Auto Encoders (MAEs) have emerged\\nas powerful architectures. By learning to reconstruct masked\\nspectrograms, they capture both local and global information\\nabout the audio data. This enables audio MAEs, such as au-\\ndioMAE [22] and EAT [19], to extract relevant high-level\\nspeech information. We initially employ this in emotion de-\\ntection, as discussed in section 4.1, and subsequently apply it\\nto deepfake detection, as detailed in section 4.2).\\n2.3. Multi-modal Representation Learning\\nMulti-modal approaches can be classified into three cate-\\ngories. The first is early fusion, a popular technique where\\ninputs from multiple modalities are concatenated before be-\\ning fed as an input to the model. This approach may not be\\nsuitable for modalities with different characteristics, as fea-\\ntures from one modality could dominate the others. Methods\\nsuch as [11, 12] have applied early fusion to analyze features\\nsuch as synchronization. The second category, late fusion, in-\\nvolves learning embeddings for each modality separately and\\nconcatenating them at the end for downstream tasks. Prior\\nworks like [12] use late fusion, although these methods strug-\\ngle to effectively learn embeddings from both modalities. Our\\narchitecture employs the third category, middle fusion. Mid-\\ndle fusion applies cross-attention to the learned embeddings\\nbefore a second-stage encoder processes them, effectively\\nlearning from both modalities. IAT [23] demonstrated the\\neffectiveness of middle fusion in emotion detection.3. METHODOLOGY\\n3.1. Datasets\\nWe use a total of 5 audio-visual datasets in this study: DFDC\\n[24], Faceforensics++ [25], FakeA VCeleb [ ?], Deepfake-\\nTIMIT [ ?] and RA VDESS [26]. These datasets feature clips\\nwhere the speaker is facing the camera.\\nThe DeepFake Detection Challenge Dataset (DFDC)\\nis the largest video deepfake dataset containing more than\\n100,000 video clips. We filtered the dataset to keep only\\nvideos with a single subject in front of the camera. Since\\nthis study makes use of other datasets, to maintain data bal-\\nance with other datasets used in this study, we retained only\\n5,200 video clips. Faceforensics++ comprises 5000 video\\nclips collected from YouTube and manipulated using meth-\\nods such as: Deepfakes [27], NeuralTextures [28], Face2Face\\n[29], and FaceSwap [30]. We filtered the Faceforensics++\\ndataset to contain clips with only one active subject. Af-\\nter filtering, and due to YouTube data availability, our final\\ndataset contains 1,400 video clips. FakeA VCeleb consists of\\n500 real videos and more than 20,000 fake videos from five\\nethnic groups, each with 100 real videos from 100 subjects.\\nWe consider four categories within this dataset: fakeAu-\\ndio+fakeVideo (FAFV), fakeAudio+realVideo (FARV), re-\\nalAudio+fakeVideo (RAFV), and realAudio+realVideo (RARV).\\nDeepfakeTIMIT consists of 320 fake videos from 32 subjects\\nmanipulated using the FaceSwap technique. We use the\\nhigher-quality data in this study. The Ryerson Audio-Visual\\nDatabase of Emotional Speech and Song (RA VDESS) con-\\ntains over 1,000 utterances and high-resolution videos for 24\\nactors showcasing different emotions.\\nWe follow the train/eval/test splits specified by each\\ndataset. For training our model to identify deepfakes, we\\nuse DeepfakeTIMIT, which contains only fake data, and the\\nRA VDESS dataset, which contains only real data, exclusively\\nfor training to ensure a balanced representation of fake and\\nreal content. Our training, validation, and test sets all contain\\nboth ’real’ and ’fake’ video samples, labeled as 0 or 1, respec-\\ntively. For emotion detection, we benchmark our model using\\nthe RA VDESS dataset, classifying eight different emotions.\\nWe follow the train/test/val splits provided in the RA VDESS\\nrepo.\\n3.2. Metrics\\nTo assess the performance of our model and baselines, we use\\nclassification accuracy (ACC) and the Area Under the Curve\\n(AUC), as these metrics commonly benchmark state-of-the-\\nart models. We focus on ACC when benchmarking emotion\\ndetection due to the presence of multiple classes, while we\\nemphasize AUC for deepfake detection, given the highly un-\\nbalanced nature of the dataset.', metadata={'source': '2D3MF.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='3.3. Video Encoder\\nOur literature review indicates that models trained on low-\\nlevel video features tend to underperform when analyzing\\nlow-quality videos, including those that have been modified\\nthrough processes like compression. In contrast, models like\\nLipForensics [31] prioritize learning lexical content by fo-\\ncusing on features in the mouth region. Building on this\\napproach, we plan to extend the scope of learning to include\\nnot only the high-level features around the mouth area but\\nalso the overall facial structure.\\nTo facilitate broader learning, we propose employing ran-\\ndom masking on portions of the image (effectively setting\\ntheir values to zero). This method will encourage the model\\nto recognize and learn a diverse range of features, thereby\\nenhancing its adaptability and accuracy. With this in mind,\\nwe leverage MARLIN [16] as the feature extractor in the\\nvideo modality. MARLIN excels in its understanding of fa-\\ncial features—ranging from the nose to the eyes—through an\\nadvanced encoder-decoder architecture. Furthermore, MAR-\\nLIN exhibits impressive performances across a variety of\\ndownstream tasks. Its applications extend to emotion recog-\\nnition and the identification of deepfake content, showcasing\\nits embedding’s adaptability. We have modified the MAR-\\nLIN model to enable it to capture more compact information\\nacross extended timesteps, thereby enhancing the temporal\\ndimension of each video.\\n3.4. Audio Encoder\\nThe characteristics of the audio encoder differ significantly\\nfrom those of the video modality. Our goal is to study audio\\nrepresentations, specifically embeddings from networks, that\\nabstract relevant information about speakers with little vari-\\nability. As a result, we explore a variety of audio backbones.\\nWe leverage five distinct audio encoders:\\n•MFCC: we extract 10 Melfrequency cepstral coeffi-\\ncients (MFCC) per second. These are simple features\\nthat we adopt as our baseline as previous literature\\nshows their robustness for speech related tasks.\\n•Xvectors: embeddings extracted from a deep neural\\nnetwork. Aladeh et al., [21] demonstrated the relevance\\nof xvectors embeddings for emotion recognition tasks.\\n•ResNet18: following a similar apprach as with xvec-\\ntors, we experimented with a Resnet18 architecture\\npre-trained to classify 8 emotions from the RA VDESS\\ndataset. We use the intermediate outputs from the\\nsecond to last layer as out embeddings.\\n•emotion2vec: with the same relationship between the\\nrobustness of emotion embeddings for deepfake detec-\\ntion, we adopt the use of the emotion2vec [18] network,\\na self-supervised network that generates emotion em-\\nbeddings from raw audio waveforms.•EAT [19] (Efficient Audio Transformer): an Au-\\ndio Masked Auto Encoder (MAE), excels at capturing\\nboth local and global audio characteristics.

Hence, our proposal model follows a similar archi-\\ntecture to a study that performs multimodal emotion recogni-\\ntion architecture, initially designed for emotion detection, to\\neffectively analyze both video and audio cues.\\nOur video and audio embeddings are extracted per second\\nusing our respective encoders, as detailed in sections 3.3 and\\n3.4. These embeddings are subsequently fused through cross-\\nattention transformer blocks, creating a multimodal represen-\\ntation. This representation leverages characteristics of visual\\nand auditory information to capture temporal dependencies\\nand implement attention mechanisms. The fused data is then\\nprocessed by a second-stage encoder that learns from both\\nmodalities. The architecture of our transformer block is illus-\\ntrated in Figure 3. During our ablation studies, we modify the\\ntransformer block to either refuse or more effectively capture\\ncharacteristics within a single modality.\\nFig. 3 .

The results are detailed in\\nTable 1, where our model demonstrated state-of-the-art per-\\nformance in emotion classification achieving a 83.6% ACC.\\nParticularly, the combination of EAT and Marlin performed\\nthe best. This performance is attributed to EAT’s capability\\nto effectively capture both local and global audio information\\nand its ability to present a high amount of temporal dimen-\\nsions. We would like to mention that while IAT trimmed its\\nvideo inputs to 3.6 seconds to capture essential video infor-\\nmation efficiently, our approach standardized video inputs to\\nan average duration of 10 seconds, which is the average time\\nacross all the datasets we used in our experiments (includ-\\ning the deepfake datasets). This standardization resulted in\\nalmost all videos being padded, introducing non-essential au-\\ndio data into the analysis.\\n4.2.

On the other hand, us-\\ning MFCCs as audio features, which makes the architecture\\naudio-visual (A V), allows for performance improvements.\\nThis showcases the potential of using an audio-visual archi-', metadata={'source': '2D3MF.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='tecture for deepfake detection. Further performance improve-\\nments are achieved with more sophisticated audio feature\\nextractors. On this test dataset, xvector and ResNet18 seem\\nto achieve similar performance when included in the audio-\\nvisual task. On the other hand, the benefits of emotion2vec\\ncompared to the baseline are clear; however, other audio\\nbackbones appear to be more robust in terms of their AUC\\nand ACC scores. The best performing model, Marlin + EAT,\\nachieves the highest AUC (0.9897) and ACC (0.9533), out-\\nperforming the SOTA model, Realforensics [32], by 0.05%\\nin AUC.\\nWhen it comes to the DFDC dataset, we observe that all\\nof our proposed architectures outperform the baseline model\\n(see Table 3). Interestingly, for this benchmark, the emo-\\ntion2vec audio backbone contributes to better deepfake de-\\ntection performance compared to xvectors or ResNet18. We\\nattribute this trend to the higher quality of video forgeries in\\nDFDC, where emotion2vec more effectively detects relation-\\nships with the audio domain, thereby improving classifica-\\ntions. Overall, DFDC is a larger test set that contains a greater\\nvariety in deepfake forgeries. This variety also contributes to\\nthe slight performance degradation observed in Marlin + EAT.\\nNevertheless, most of our proposed architectures outperform\\nthe state-of-the-art model (Face X-ray [33]).\\nWe also performed benchmarking on the FakeA VCeleb\\ndataset (see Table 4). This dataset is particularly relevant be-\\ncause it contains a higher proportion of audio-based forgeries\\nthan other datasets. As a result, our benchmarking of dif-\\nferent audio backbones shows more variability. This time,\\nemotion2vec and MFCCs produced suboptimal results, in-\\ndicating that these methods may not be effective and can-\\nnot generalize well to scenarios where the audio is predom-\\ninantly modified. However, other methods such as xvectors\\nand ResNet18 prove resilient under such conditions. Over-\\nall, the best-performing method we achieved is Marlin+EAT,\\nwhich also outperforms the state-of-the-art model (A VFak-\\neNet [34]) by 0.06% in AUC and 0.02% in ACC.\\nNote: all experiments presented in this section used the\\ntrain splits from 5 datasets from section 3.1, evaluated on the\\nvalidation split and tested on the test split of the dataset of\\ninterest.\\n4.3. Deepfake cross-dataset generalization\\nWhen it comes to deepfake datasets, it is common for the\\ntrain, evaluation, and test sets to all contain similar forgery\\ntechniques. This can be a source of concern when the inten-\\ntion is to deploy a deepfake detection model for real-world ap-\\nplications. For this reason, we test the generalization capabil-\\nities of our best model, Marlin + EAT, using unseen datasets.\\nTable 4.3 showcases our model’s generalization capabilities,\\nhaving been trained on various datasets but tested on different,\\nunseen ones. For these experiments, we use all five datasets\\npresented in section 3.1, training on four and leaving onefor testing. Thus, we demonstrate our model’s generalization\\nacross five different conditions, each time selecting a different\\ndataset’s test split for benchmarking. Overall, we observe that\\nour model’s classification capabilities regress by only 0.02%\\non average compared to the original benchmarks presented\\nin Tables 2, 3, and 4. It is also worth noting that Marlin +\\nEAT performs quite well in classifying real-only videos (us-\\ning RA VDESS as test set) and fake-only videos (using Deep-\\nfakeTIMIT as test set).\\n4.4. Ablation Studies\\nFor our ablation studies, three primary approaches were em-\\nployed. The first was dropping out a modality during training.\\nPrevious research [23] has indicated that introducing random\\nnoise or dropping a modality can prevent the model from\\noverly depending on a single modality, thus enhancing per-\\nformance in scenarios where one modality may be compro-\\nmised or absent. However, our models exhibited decreased\\nperformance under these conditions, showing approximately\\n0.1 lower scores in the AUC metric for deepfake detection.\\nWe believe this is due to the nature of our datasets, where all\\nbut one contain only one modality that is falsified. As such,\\ndepending on the dropped modality, our model’s ability to dif-\\nferentiate between fake and real media will be significantly\\nimpeded.\\nThe second ablation study focused on different types of\\nfusion techniques. As our pretrained first-stage encoders were\\nnot originally designed to process multiple modalities simul-\\ntaneously, we evaluated our model by comparing middle fu-\\nsion with late fusion, omitting the second-stage encoders for\\nlate fusion. During late fusion, we observed an average de-\\ncrease in performance of approximately 10% in AUC, affect-\\ning both deepfake detection and emotion recognition tasks.\\nThe third ablation study was conducted using different\\nmiddle fusion blocks, where we experimented with combin-\\ning audio and video modalities in six different ways. The\\ndefault fusion mechanism is detailed in Section 3.5. In this\\ncontext, zaandzvdenote the embeddings generated by the\\nfirst-stage encoders for the audio and visual modalities, re-\\nspectively. The transformer block T1,2, illustrated in Figure 3,\\nemploys modalities 1 and 2 as the key/value and query modal-\\nities, respectively. The symbol hrepresents the output of the\\ntransformer block T. Each middle fusion approach manipu-\\nlates these embeddings differently:\\n•Default Middle Fusion:\\nhav=Tav(zv, za), h va=Tva(za, zv)\\n•Audio Reuse Fusion:\\nhva=Tva(za, zv), h av=Tav(zv+hva, za)\\n•Video Reuse Fusion:\\nhav=Tav(zv, za), h va=Tva(za+hav, zv)', metadata={'source': '2D3MF.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

We use Marlin + EAT, as the combina-\\ntion of these two models outperformed all other models. We\\nshow our results on table 6.\\nFor emotion recognition performance, we see that our de-\\nfault middle fusion block (one layer of cross attention trans-\\nformer) performed the best. We had hypothesised that due\\nto the high performance in audio only over video, the au-\\ndio modality would play a more crucial factor into our trans-\\nformer block, but did not see much improvement on audio\\nrefuse. Since our first stage encoders have self-attention built\\nin them, we observed that our default fusion, where we per-\\nformed cross attention once, performed the best. We think\\nthis is because that our first stage encoders have strong repre-\\nsentations of each modality individually, and due to the small\\ndataset of RA VDESS, it was most effective when only apply-\\ning transformer block once.\\nFor deepfake detection performance, we observed a\\nmarginal change of less than 1% in performance metrics.\\nSuch a minor variation is not statistically significant, given\\nthe fluctuations in AUC performance across different runs.\\nWe attribute this stability to the amount of data utilized for\\ntraining, which likely provided a robust foundation for the\\nmodel, diminishing the impact of small modifications in the\\nprocessing pipeline.Model Task ACC ↑AUC\\nVideo Refuse Emotion 0.596 0.936\\nAudio Reuse Emotion 0.679 0.942\\nSelf & Cross-Attention Emotion 0.712 0.948\\nMulti-Attention Emotion 0.741 0.962\\nSelf-Attention Emotion 0.779 0.956\\nDefault Emotion 0.836 0.954\\nTable 6 .

CONCLUSION\\nWe have successfully demonstrated that our 2D3MF archi-\\ntecture excels in emotion recognition, translating this profi-\\nciency into deepfake detection. Throughout our experiments,\\nour framework has proven its ability to leverage emotional\\ncharacteristics extracted from pre-trained audio and video\\nnetworks to accurately identify manipulated content. By in-\\ntegrating facial feature extractors such as EfficientFace and\\nvideo masked auto-encoder (MAE) technologies like MAR-\\nLIN, coupled with different audio feature extractors, our\\napproach significantly enhances deepfake detection. The use\\nof multimodal data not only overcomes the limitations of\\nprevious detection methods but also significantly improves\\ndetection accuracy, even in scenarios where one or both\\nmodalities have been falsified.\\n5.1.
